# ConcreteStrength

Concrete compressive strength tests are among the most common forms of testing conducted in the construction industry.

On behalf of a client relying on an AutoML solution, I was tasked with building a regression to improve their modelling capability.

Due to the sensitivity/privacy of this engagement, exploratory data analysis and the final features used for the project have been excluded.
